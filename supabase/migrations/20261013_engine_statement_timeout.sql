-- Self-managed execution budget for the draft resolver + heartbeat sweep
--
-- PostgREST applies role-level caps that cancel long-running RPC statements:
-- the anon role gets statement_timeout=3s and authenticated gets 8s. The
-- draft engine's per-turn work (the weakness-aware pool fallback plus the
-- automatic bot chain after a human pick) can legitimately exceed those caps
-- during a busy stretch, so Postgres kills the statement mid-insert and rolls
-- everything back. The client watches a resolve that never commits; the
-- server heartbeat sweeps retry on the same locked rows; and the draft
-- stalls at exactly the round where the chain got long (the recurring
-- "round 5 hang"). Both engine functions are SECURITY DEFINER (they run as
-- the table owner), so they set their own generous statement/lock budget for
-- the transaction and are no longer hostage to whichever role invoked them.

-- Recreates advance_overdue_drafts with a lifted execution budget. Behavior
-- is otherwise unchanged: it resolves every active, unpaused draft whose turn
-- is due and records one audit row per invocation.
--
-- @returns The number of drafts whose turn was actually resolved.
